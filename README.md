# Plant Classifier
This repo uses TensorFlow's Inception V3 Model to classify whether an image is a tomato or a potato. 
The model can be used to classify more types of plants, simply add more labeled folders of images. 
I used [Siraj Raval's TensorFlow tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfNvhPx5Px8) to develop this. 
Another useful resource for working with TensorFlow's Inception V3 Model is [CodeLab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tensorflow-for-poets/?utm_campaign=chrome_series_machinelearning_063016&utm_source=gdev&utm_medium=yt-desc#0).
